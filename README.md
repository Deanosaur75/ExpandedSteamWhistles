<p1> Create: Expanded Steam Whistles is a small addon for the Create mod that adds a new Extended Steam Whistle block.

The Extended Steam Whistle works the same way as Create’s normal Steam Whistle, but with a much larger pitch range covering five octaves. This makes it possible to play both much higher and much lower notes than usual.

With the extra range, players can make more detailed melodies, build better-sounding musical contraptions, and more closely recreate proper pipe organ songs.

It is fully compatible with Create and does not change how existing Create mechanics work.</p1>
